description: malan + ed / malan + lane + ed

As a suffix, -ed is often added to the end of the word to make it past tense. It suggests that you've accomplished or completed something. Using the word “baked” as opposed to “bake” suggests the baking has already occurred.

extra tip: Project start as personal website of mine. Content will available soon.
